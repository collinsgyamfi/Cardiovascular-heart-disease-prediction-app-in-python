### Project Overview
Cardiovascular disease is one of the main cause of death worldwide. Identifying and predicting the disease in patients is the first step towards stopping its progression. The capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using survey data was evaluated, and key variables that contribute to the disease among patient was identified within the data.
This would help Patient and healthcare professional to quickly and easily identify patient that are at high risk of suffering from cardiovascular disease.

### Tools

 - Python - Data Analysis
 - Matplotlib - For Data Visualizations
 - Seaborn - For Data Visualizations
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Scikit-learn
 - Jupyter notebook - Coding Environment
 - Vscode
 - streamlit

### Data Cleaning
In the data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks;

1. Data loading
2. Data Validation
3. Data cleaning
4. Handling Missing Data

### Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the input data is paired with corresponding output labels. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping or relationship between input features and their corresponding output labels, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. .  GradientBoostin Classifier  was used due to their effectiveness in classification tasks.

### Deployment
 - The model was saved as a pickle file for future use.
 - The application was developed using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
 - To facilitate efficient execution, the application was deployed on GitHub.
